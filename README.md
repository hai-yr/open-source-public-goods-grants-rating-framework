Creating an open-source, fork-able framework to rate public goods grants opportunities on potential for impact


We love that Gitcoin is funding public goods in a democratic way. However, sometimes the most flashy projects end up with the most funding, similar to how TV and movie stars get elected to political offices when there may be better people for the job. Weâ€™d like to create an independent framework to assess the impact of Gitcoin Grants projects and promote and put our community funds to support the projects we believe are most deserving of support.
