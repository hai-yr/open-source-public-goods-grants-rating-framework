1. Neglectedness:
What is the total investment (public, private, non-profit) into a solution or the amount of people/entities working on solutions to the stated (or implied) issue?

  Example of rating scale
  (100 billion USD = 0, 10 billion = 2, 100 million = 6, 10 million = 8, 1 million = 10, <100k = 12)
  Full time staff (1 million = 0, ... 1 or less = 12)

2. Scale: 
If this project was maximally successful how big would the relative impact be? For climate solutions, use this formula for gigatons drawdown

(0.001 Gt = 0, 0.01 = 2, 0.1 = 4, 1 = 6, 8 = 10,  10 = 100 Gt)

3. Scalability:
How scalable is the proposed solution? Is there a path to financial viability?
(similar to solvability, the doubling of $ or people working on the solution will solve X% of problem: 0.01 = 0, 100% = 8)

4. Impact Fit:
How does this solution compare to existing or other proposed solutions?

5. Team:
How likely is the team to execute on the proposed solution?

a. Collective experience

  How much experience does the team have as a whole?

  b. Industry-specific experience

  Does the team have the necessary background to understand and contribute meaningfully to solutions in the space? 

  c. Reputation/track record of execution

  Does the team have a record of building and contributing to other projects?

6. Secondary Impacts:
What are any potential secondary impacts of the proposed solution? 

  Do they align with UN SDG (Sustainable Development Goals)?

7. Efficiency:
What percent of donated funds will go towards building creating the solution vs. administrative/overhead/salaries? Is there a transparent way to track this?
